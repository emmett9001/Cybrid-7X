TODO list
---------
cells should know about their surrounding cells and generate accordingly
should read the attributes of surroundings
maybe two cells that pair and always move toward each other??
differentiate somehow between cells and selectively generate offspring
kill old cells
start at point A onscreen, move to an offscreen point B with a follow camera
particle effects
sprint button (can't use constantly though)

Reach features
--------------
make rivers or rocks, something that can't be affected by player but affects position and movement
